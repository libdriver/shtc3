## LibDriver SHTC3

[![MISRA](https://img.shields.io/badge/misra-compliant-brightgreen.svg)](/misra/README.md) [![API](https://img.shields.io/badge/api-reference-blue.svg)](https://www.libdriver.com/docs/shtc3/index.html) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg)](/LICENSE)

The SHTC3 is a digital humidity and temperature sensor designed especially for battery-driven high-volume consumer electronics applications. This sensor is strictly designed to overcome conventional limits for size, power consumption, and performance to price ratio in order to fulfill current and future requirements. Sensirion’s CMOSens® technology offers a complete sensor system on a single chip, consisting of a capacitive humidity sensor, a bandgap temperature sensor, analog and digital signal processing, A/D converter, calibration data memory, and a digital communication interface supporting I2C Fast Mode Plus. The small 2 × 2 × 0.75 mm3 DFN package enables applications in even the most limited of spaces. The sensor covers a humidity measurement range of 0 to 100 %RH and a temperature measurement range of - 40 °C to 125 °C with a typical accuracy of ±2 %RH and ±0.2°C. The broad supply voltage of 1.62 V to 3.6 V and an energy budget below 1 μJ per measurement make the SHTC3 suitable for mobile or wireless applications powered by batteries. With the industry-proven quality and reliability of Sensirion’s humidity and temperature sensors and constant accuracy over a large measurement range, the SHTC3 offers best performance-to-price ratio. 

LibDriver SHTC3 is a full-featured driver for SHTC3, launched by LibDriver. It provides normal reading, low power reading and additional features. LibDriver is MISRA compliant.

### Instruction

/src includes LibDriver SHTC3 source files.

/interface includes LibDriver SHTC3 IIC platform independent template.

/test includes LibDriver SHTC3 driver test code and this code can test the chip necessary function simply.

/example includes LibDriver SHTC3 sample code.

/doc includes LibDriver SHTC3 offline document.

/datasheet includes SHTC3 datasheet.

/project includes the common Linux and MCU development board sample code. All projects use the shell script to debug the driver and the detail instruction can be found in each project's README.md.

/misra includes the LibDriver MISRA code scanning results.

### Install

Reference /interface IIC platform independent template and finish your platform IIC driver.

Add the /src directory, the interface driver for your platform, and your own drivers to your project, if you want to use the default example drivers, add the /example directory to your project.

### Usage

You can refer to the examples in the /example directory to complete your own driver. If you want to use the default programming examples, here's how to use them.

#### example basic

```C
#include "driver_shtc3_basic.h"

uint8_t res;
uint32_t i;
float temperature;
float humidity;

/* basic init */
res = shtc3_basic_init();
if (res != 0)
{
    return 1;
}

...
    
/* loop */
for (i = 0; i < 3; i++)
{
    /* delay 1000ms */
    shtc3_interface_delay_ms(1000);

    /* read data */
    res = shtc3_basic_read((float *)&temperature, (float *)&humidity);
    if (res != 0)
    {
        (void)shtc3_basic_deinit();

        return 1;
    }

    /* output */
    shtc3_interface_debug_print("shtc3: %d/%d.\n", (uint32_t)(i + 1), (uint32_t)3);
    shtc3_interface_debug_print("shtc3: temperature is %0.2fC.\n", temperature);
    shtc3_interface_debug_print("shtc3: humidity is %0.2f%%.\n", humidity);
    
    ...
}

...

/* loop */
for (i = 0; i < 3; i++)
{
    /* delay 1000ms */
    shtc3_interface_delay_ms(1000);

    /* read data */
    res = shtc3_basic_read_low_power((float *)&temperature, (float *)&humidity);
    if (res != 0)
    {
        (void)shtc3_basic_deinit();

        return 1;
    }

    /* output */
    shtc3_interface_debug_print("shtc3: %d/%d.\n", (uint32_t)(i + 1), (uint32_t)3);
    shtc3_interface_debug_print("shtc3: temperature is %0.2fC.\n", temperature);
    shtc3_interface_debug_print("shtc3: humidity is %0.2f%%.\n", humidity);
    
    ...
}  

...
    
/* basic deinit */
(void)shtc3_basic_deinit();

return 0;
```
